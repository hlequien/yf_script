# yf_script

A lot of people do "Hello World  !" to discover a language, some prefers doing financial data tools instead.

## I) What is yf_script

yf is for Yahoo Finance and script because it's a script and I have a damn lack of immagination to find a name.

yf_script is my first ruby project and it's about scrapping data from Yahoo! Finance and use it with a lot of tools (RSI, Stochastic, bollinger bands, etc)
The final purpose is to make a script wich can be used to manage portfolio or format information for further use (in Excel, R, backtest a trading algo, etc)

## II) Why yf_script

Well, it's my first ruby script and to learn ruby, I wanted to do something I like and I need to make sure I go to through.
And I used yahoo finance API because you can use it with any language while this language can use a network.
The documentation is pretty clear and the availability is close to 100%.
I know it's delayed for most of stocks and you can't get historical intraday data but it's free of cost and registration.

## III) Who needs this ?

Honnestly, me and maybe other peoples
But if you're interrested in financial market, and you need a script to quickly prepare a spreadsheet, I think you should take a look at this (when it'll be finished)
I know, it's ugly, it's in a terminal and there is only text, but if you want to add a GUI, please fork this repo and send a pull request when you're done, I'll merge if it looks good. (Yes, I hate doing GUIs, I love back-end)

NB : It's Ruby (it's not as fast as C) and Yahoo's delayed data, so if I add a trading algo feature, it's only for demonstration purpose.
